            <p class="C-4">The 3 Counties Communication Test is a vital event aimed at ensuring effective communication across the counties. This test helps in evaluating the use of TTU to achieve wide area coverage across the counties of Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire.</p>

            <p class="C-4"><strong>Date:</strong> Friday, 5th December 2025</p>

            <p class="C-4"><strong>Status:</strong> Provisional</p>

            <p class="C-4">The test involves the use of linked Talk Through Units (TTU) and a primary location in each county with a small team. Additionally, there is an opportunity to test Worcestershire's internal six district locations, which requires a larger team. Times for these tests are to be planned.</p>
